***🔍 Task 001: To-Do list Application***This is a simple command-line to-do list application built using Python. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, completing, and deleting items from the list. The application stores the to-do list in a text file, so the user's tasks persist even after the program is closed and reopened. The user can view a list of all their current tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks that are no longer needed. . 🎮💡
