## 🌟 Embarking on the CodSoft Learning Journey! 🚀
### I,m  🌟 Excited to share my journey with CodSoft as a Python Developer Intern. From mastering the basics of Python to crafting user-friendly applications, it's been an incredible ride of growth and learning. 💻✨

***🔍 Task 001: To-Do list Application***This is a simple command-line to-do list application built using Python. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, completing, and deleting items from the list. The application stores the to-do list in a text file, so the user's tasks persist even after the program is closed and reopened. The user can view a list of all their current tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks that are no longer needed. . 🎮💡

***🧮 Task 002:Calculator Application***This is a simple command-line calculator application built using Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator supports both whole numbers and decimal values, and can handle complex expressions with multiple operations. Users can enter their calculations directly into the command prompt, and the application will display the result immediately. The calculator includes error handling to catch invalid inputs or divide-by-zero errors, and provides clear error messages to the user.

***🗒️ Task 003:Password Generator***This is a command-line password generator application built using Python. It allows users to generate secure and random passwords based on their preferences, such as password length and character types. The application can create passwords containing a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Users can specify the desired password length, and the generator will produce a unique, randomized password that meets the specified criteria. The application includes options to exclude certain character types if desired, ensuring the generated passwords adhere to any restrictions or policies. The passwords are displayed directly in the command prompt, and users can choose to copy the generated passwod to their clipboard for easy use.

***🗒️ Task 004:Rock Paper Scissors***This is a simple command-line Rock Paper Scissors game application built using Python. It allows users to play the classic game against the computer. The user can choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) by entering the corresponding input at the command prompt. The computer then generates a random move, and the application determines the winner based on the standard game rules. The game keeps track of the user's and computer's scores, displaying the current standings after each round. Users can play multiple rounds and the application will announce the final winner at the end of the game. 
### 💼 Conclusion

Reflecting on my journey, I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn, collaborate, and grow with CodSoft. Each task has been a stepping stone towards becoming a proficient Python developer. Excited to continue honing my skills and contributing meaningfully to future projects! 💪🎓
